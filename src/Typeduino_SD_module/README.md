# Typeduino SD Card dip switch module
## Building and pinout instructions
In order to build this module, you need:
- 1x Arduino-like ATMega32U4 microcontroller
- 1x Button
- 1x 4 pin dip switch
- 1x micro-SD card reader (HW-125)
- 1x 10k Î© resistor

The pinout is as follows:
- PIN 2: Button
- PIN 6: DIP switch 1
- PIN 7: DIP switch 2
- PIN 8: DIP switch 3
- PIN 9: DIP switch 4
- PIN 10: CS Pin of SD card
- PIN 14: MISO Pin of SD card
- PIN 15: SCK Pin of SD card
- PIN 16: MOSI Pin of SD card

## Connection check

Once mounted, to check if the connection is correct, you can use the check_connection.ino sketch. It should return something like this:

```
Typeduino initialized

Checking SD Card connection 
Wiring is correct and a card is present.

Card type: SDHC

Files found on the card (name, date and size in bytes): 
0000.TXT      2022-09-08 09:50:08 15
Current dip switch state is: 0000
``` 

## Usage

Load ducky scripts on SD card and name it with the a switch state. For example, 0000.txt, 1000.txt... 
Then, select the script you want to execute with the dip switch and press the button. The script will be executed.

## Debugging

If the device is not working properly there is a debug option you can activate in the code. Line 10 of the Typeduino_SD_module.ino file:
```
#define DEBUG true
```
This will print all kind of useful information on the serial monitor to diagnose the what is going wrong.
